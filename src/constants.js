**Initial Screening**\n\n
All legislation submissions will be put through an initial screening to ensure compliance with terms and conditions.\n\n
**Evaluation and Selection**\n\n
Decisions will be based on the following factors:\n\n\n\n
* **Technical Merit**\n\n  * Has the submission presented a clear understanding of the associated problems being addressed?\n  * Has the submission developed a logical and workable solution and approach to solving the problem(s)?\n  * What are the most significant aspects of this concept?\n  * Has the submission clearly described the breadth of impact of the change?\n\n\n\n
* **Originality**\n\n  * To what extent is this concept new, or in what way is this a variation of an existing idea?\n  * How is this concept unique?\n  * Does the concept use technical solutions rather than traditional approaches that often rely on enforcement?\n    * (Aim to create a law like the one that requires cars to include seatbelt reminder alerts, not like seatbelt laws that require traffic stops to enforce.)\n\n\n\n
* **Practicality**\n\n  * Who directly benefits from this concept?\n  * Can the improvements and the related activities be implemented in a practical manner?\n  * To what extent does the concept demonstrate a reasonable path for implementation?\n  * How likely is the concept to be accepted and easily used by the public sector?\n  * What are the costs anticipated to be incurred and the costs saved by executing this concept compared to the benefit to the public.\n\n
